// All of your book objects are going to be stored in an array,
// so youâ€™ll need a constructor for books.
// Then, add a separate function to the script (not inside the constructor) that can take some arguments, create a book from those arguments, and store the new book object into an array.
// Also, all of your book objects should have a unique id, which can be generated using crypto.randomUUID(). This ensures each book has a unique and stable identifier, preventing issues when books are removed or rearranged.
